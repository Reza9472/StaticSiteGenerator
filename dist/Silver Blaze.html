He has always, however, been a<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">prime favourite with the racing public, and has never yet<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">disappointed them, so that even at those odds enormous sums of<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">money have been laid upon him. It is obvious, therefore, that<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">there were many people who had the strongest interest in<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">preventing Silver Blaze from being there at the fall of the flag<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">next Tuesday.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“The fact was, of course, appreciated at King’s Pyland, where the<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">Colonel’s training-stable is situated. Every precaution was taken<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">to guard the favourite. The trainer, John Straker, is a retired<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">jockey who rode in Colonel Ross’s colours before he became too<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">heavy for the weighing-chair. He has served the Colonel for five<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">years as jockey and for seven as trainer, and has always shown<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">himself to be a zealous and honest servant. Under him were three<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">lads; for the establishment was a small one, containing only four<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">characters. John Straker, who is a married man, lived in a small<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">villa about two hundred yards from the stables. He has no<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">horses in all. One of these lads sat up each night in the stable,<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">children, keeps one maid-servant, and is comfortably off. The<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">while the others slept in the loft. All three bore excellent<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">country round is very lonely, but about half a mile to the north<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">there is a small cluster of villas which have been built by a<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">Tavistock contractor for the use of invalids and others who may<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">wish to enjoy the pure Dartmoor air. Tavistock itself lies two<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">miles to the west, while across the moor, also about two miles<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">distant, is the larger training establishment of Mapleton, which<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">belongs to Lord Backwater, and is managed by Silas Brown. In<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">every other direction the moor is a complete wilderness,<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">inhabited only by a few roaming gypsies. Such was the general<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">situation last Monday night when the catastrophe occurred.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“On that evening the horses had been exercised and watered as<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">usual, and the stables were locked up at nine o’clock. Two of the<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">lads walked up to the trainer’s house, where they had supper in<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">the kitchen, while the third, Ned Hunter, remained on guard. At a<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">few minutes after nine the maid, Edith Baxter, carried down to<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">the stables his supper, which consisted of a dish of curried<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">mutton. She took no liquid, as there was a water-tap in the<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">stables, and it was the rule that the lad on duty should drink<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">nothing else. The maid carried a lantern with her, as it was very<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">dark and the path ran across the open moor.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“Edith Baxter was within thirty yards of the stables, when a man<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">appeared out of the darkness and called to her to stop. As he<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">stepped into the circle of yellow light thrown by the lantern she<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">saw that he was a person of gentlemanly bearing, dressed in a<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">grey suit of tweeds, with a cloth cap. He wore gaiters, and<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">carried a heavy stick with a knob to it.

His age, she thought, would be rather over thirty<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“‘Can you tell me where I am?’ he asked. ‘I had almost made up my<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">mind to sleep on the moor, when I saw the light of your lantern.’</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“‘You are close to the King’s Pyland training-stables,’ said she.<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“‘Oh, indeed!

Then he clambered up to<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">the rim of the hollow, and crawled about among the ferns and<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">bushes.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“I am afraid that there are no more tracks,” said the Inspector.<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“I have examined the ground very carefully for a hundred yards in</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">each direction.”<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“Indeed!” said Holmes, rising. “I should not have the<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">impertinence to do it again after what you say. But I should like<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">to take a little walk over the moor before it grows dark, that I<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">may know my ground to-morrow, and I think that I shall put this<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">horseshoe into my pocket for luck.”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">Colonel Ross, who had shown some signs of impatience at my<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">companion’s quiet and systematic method of work, glanced at his<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">watch. “I wish you would come back with me, Inspector,” said he.<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“There are several points on which I should like your advice, and<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">especially as to whether we do not owe it to the public to remove<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">our horse’s name from the entries for the Cup.”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“Certainly not,” cried Holmes, with decision. “I should let the<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">name stand.”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">The Colonel bowed. “I am very glad to have had your opinion,<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">sir,” said he. “You will find us at poor Straker’s house when you<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">have finished your walk, and we can drive together into<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">Tavistock.”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">He turned back with the Inspector, while Holmes and I walked<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">slowly across the moor. The sun was beginning to sink behind the<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">stables of Mapleton, and the long, sloping plain in front of us<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">was tinged with gold, deepening into rich, ruddy browns where the<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">faded ferns and brambles caught the evening light. But the<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">glories of the landscape were all wasted upon my companion, who<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">was sunk in the deepest thought.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“It’s this way, Watson,” said he at last. “We may leave the<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">question of who killed John Straker for the instant, and confine<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">ourselves to finding out what has become of the horse. Now,<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">supposing that he broke away during or after the tragedy, where<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">could he have gone to? The horse is a very gregarious creature.<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">If left to himself his instincts would have been either to return<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">to King’s Pyland or go over to Mapleton. Why should he run wild<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">upon the moor? He would surely have been seen by now. And why<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">should gypsies kidnap him? These people always clear out when<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">they hear of trouble, for they do not wish to be pestered by the<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">police. They could not hope to sell such a horse. They would run<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">a great risk and gain nothing by taking him. Surely that is<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">clear.”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“Where is he, then?”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“I have already said that he must have gone to King’s Pyland or<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">to Mapleton. He is not at King’s Pyland. Therefore he is at<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">Mapleton. Let us take that as a working hypothesis and see what<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">it leads us to. This part of the moor, as the Inspector remarked,<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">is very hard and dry. But it falls away towards Mapleton, and you<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">can see from here that there is a long hollow over yonder, which<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">must have been very wet on Monday night. If our supposition is<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">correct, then the horse must have crossed that, and there is the<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">point where we should look for his tracks.”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">We had been walking briskly during this conversation, and a few<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">more minutes brought us to the hollow in question. At Holmes’<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">request I walked down the bank to the right, and he to the left,<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">but I had not taken fifty paces before I heard him give a shout,<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">and saw him waving his hand to me. The track of a horse was<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">plainly outlined in the soft earth in front of him, and the shoe<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">which he took from his pocket exactly fitted the impression.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“See the value of imagination,” said Holmes. “It is the one<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">quality which Gregory lacks. We imagined what might have<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">justified. Let us proceed.”<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">happened, acted upon the supposition, and find ourselves<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">We crossed the marshy bottom and passed over a quarter of a mile</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">of dry, hard turf. Again the ground sloped, and again we came on<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">the tracks. Then we lost them for half a mile, but only to pick<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">them up once more quite close to Mapleton. It was Holmes who saw<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">them first, and he stood pointing with a look of triumph upon his<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">face. A man’s track was visible beside the horse’s.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“The horse was alone before,” I cried.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“Quite so. It was alone before. Hullo, what is this?”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">The double track turned sharp off and took the direction of<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">King’s Pyland. Holmes whistled, and we both followed along after<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">it. His eyes were on the trail, but I happened to look a little<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">to one side, and saw to my surprise the same tracks coming back<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">again in the opposite direction.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“One for you, Watson,” said Holmes, when I pointed it out. “You<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">have saved us a long walk, which would have brought us back on<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">our own traces. Let us follow the return track.”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">We had not to go far. It ended at the paving of asphalt which led<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">groom ran out from them.<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">up to the gates of the Mapleton stables. As we approached, a</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“We don’t want any loiterers about here,” said he.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“I only wished to ask a question,” said Holmes, with his finger<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">and thumb in his waistcoat pocket. “Should I be too early to see<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">your master, Mr. Silas Brown, if I were to call at five o’clock<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">to-morrow morning?”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“Bless you, sir, if any one is about he will be, for he is always<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">for himself. No, sir, no; it is as much as my place is worth to<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">the first stirring. But here he is, sir, to answer your questions<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">let him see me touch your money.

Go about your<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">business! And you, what the devil do you want here?”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“Ten minutes’ talk with you, my good sir,” said Holmes in the<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">sweetest of voices.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“I’ve no time to talk to every gadabout.

Be off, or you may find a dog at your heels.”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">Holmes leaned forward and whispered something in the trainer’s<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">ear. He started violently and flushed to the temples.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“It’s a lie!” he shouted, “an infernal lie!”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“Very good.

Powdered opium<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">is by no means tasteless. The flavour is not disagreeable, but it<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">is perceptible. Were it mixed with any ordinary dish the eater<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">would undoubtedly detect it, and would probably eat no more. A<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">curry was exactly the medium which would disguise this taste. By<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">no possible supposition could this stranger, Fitzroy Simpson,<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">have caused curry to be served in the trainer’s family that<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">night, and it is surely too monstrous a coincidence to suppose<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">that he happened to come along with powdered opium upon the very<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">night when a dish happened to be served which would disguise the<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">flavour. That is unthinkable. Therefore Simpson becomes<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">eliminated from the case, and our attention centres upon Straker<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">and his wife, the only two people who could have chosen curried<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">mutton for supper that night. The opium was added after the dish<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">was set aside for the stable-boy, for the others had the same for<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">supper with no ill effects. Which of them, then, had access to<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">that dish without the maid seeing them?</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“Before deciding that question I had grasped the significance of<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">the silence of the dog, for one true inference invariably<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">suggests others. The Simpson incident had shown me that a dog was<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">kept in the stables, and yet, though some one had been in and had<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">fetched out a horse, he had not barked enough to arouse the two<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">lads in the loft. Obviously the midnight visitor was some one<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">whom the dog knew well.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“I was already convinced, or almost convinced, that John Straker<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">went down to the stables in the dead of the night and took out<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">Silver Blaze. For what purpose? For a dishonest one, obviously,<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">or why should he drug his own stable-boy? And yet I was at a loss<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">to know why. There have been cases before now where trainers have<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">made sure of great sums of money by laying against their own<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">horses, through agents, and then preventing them from winning by<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">fraud. Sometimes it is a pulling jockey. Sometimes it is some<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">surer and subtler means. What was it here? I hoped that the<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">contents of his pockets might help me to form a conclusion.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“And they did so. You cannot have forgotten the singular knife<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">which was found in the dead man’s hand, a knife which certainly<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">no sane man would choose for a weapon. It was, as Dr. Watson told<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">us, a form of knife which is used for the most delicate<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">operations known in surgery. And it was to be used for a delicate<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">operation that night. You must know, with your wide experience of<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">turf matters, Colonel Ross, that it is possible to make a slight<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">nick upon the tendons of a horse’s ham, and to do it<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">subcutaneously, so as to leave absolutely no trace. A horse so<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">treated would develop a slight lameness, which would be put down<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">to a strain in exercise or a touch of rheumatism, but never to<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">foul play.”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“Villain! Scoundrel!” cried the Colonel.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“We have here the explanation of why John Straker wished to take<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">the horse out on to the moor. So spirited a creature would have<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">certainly roused the soundest of sleepers when it felt the prick<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">of the knife. It was absolutely necessary to do it in the open<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">air.”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“I have been blind!” cried the Colonel. “Of course that was why<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">he needed the candle, and struck the match.”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“Undoubtedly. But in examining his belongings I was fortunate<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">enough to discover not only the method of the crime, but even its<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">motives. As a man of the world, Colonel, you know that men do not<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">carry other people’s bills about in their pockets. We have most<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">of us quite enough to do to settle our own. I at once concluded<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">that Straker was leading a double life, and keeping a second<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">establishment. The nature of the bill showed that there was a<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">lady in the case, and one who had expensive tastes. Liberal as<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">you are with your servants, one can hardly expect that they can<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">buy twenty-guinea walking dresses for their ladies. I questioned<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">Mrs. Straker as to the dress without her knowing it, and having<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">satisfied myself that it had never reached her, I made a note of<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">the milliner’s address, and felt that by calling there with<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">Straker’s photograph I could easily dispose of the mythical<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">Derbyshire.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“From that time on all was plain. Straker had led out the horse<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">to a hollow where his light would be invisible. Simpson in his<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">flight had dropped his cravat, and Straker had picked it up—with<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">some idea, perhaps, that he might use it in securing the horse’s<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">leg. Once in the hollow, he had got behind the horse and had<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">struck a light; but the creature frightened at the sudden glare,<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">and with the strange instinct of animals feeling that some<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">mischief was intended, had lashed out, and the steel shoe had<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">struck Straker full on the forehead. He had already, in spite of<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">the rain, taken off his overcoat in order to do his delicate<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">task, and so, as he fell, his knife gashed his thigh. Do I make<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">it clear?”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“Wonderful!” cried the Colonel. “Wonderful! You might have been<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">there!”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“My final shot was, I confess a very long one. It struck me that<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">so astute a man as Straker would not undertake this delicate<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">tendon-nicking without a little practice. What could he practice<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">on? My eyes fell upon the sheep, and I asked a question which,<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">rather to my surprise, showed that my surmise was correct.</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“When I returned to London I called upon the milliner, who had<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">recognised Straker as an excellent customer of the name of<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">Derbyshire, who had a very dashing wife, with a strong partiality<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">for expensive dresses. I have no doubt that this woman had<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">plunged him over head and ears in debt, and so led him into this<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">miserable plot.”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“You have explained all but one thing,” cried the Colonel. “Where<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">was the horse?”</p><br><p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">“Ah, it bolted, and was cared for by one of your neighbours. We<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">must have an amnesty in that direction, I think. This is Clapham<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">Junction, if I am not mistaken, and we shall be in Victoria in<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">less than ten minutes. If you care to smoke a cigar in our rooms,<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">Colonel, I shall be happy to give you any other details which<p style="text-align: center;  font-family: 'Gentium Basic', serif; font-size: 20px; ">might interest you.”
